# Accidents_Analysis_Mining_Framework

Developed a framework to analyze road accidents using Mining algorithms.
Used k-Modes algorithm to cluster similar types of accidents and then used Apriori Algorithm to find out patterns accidents are occurring in.
Done this as part of Data Mining Course Project. Collaborated with my project partner Shane Ragusa.
